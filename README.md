The Show Must Go On
===================

A [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader) mod for [Resonite](https://resonite.com/) that lets you keep sending audio streams to unfocused worlds. 

[Original](https://github.com/Banane9/NeosTheShowMustGoOn/) Mod here

By default this only applies to streams spawned out into the world, but continuing the voice stream is also supported.  
This doesn't affect the stream being muted when the streaming user is silenced in the world, or when a voice message gets recorded on the same audio device.

## Installation
1. Install [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader).
2. Place [TheShowMustGoOn.dll](https://github.com/NepuShiro/ResoniteTheShowMustGoOn/releases/latest/download/TheShowMustGoOn.dll) into your `rml_mods` folder. This folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Resonite\rml_mods` for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with ResoniteModLoader installed it will create the folder for you.
3. Start the game. If you want to verify that the mod is working you can check your Resonite logs.
